## How to suggest a video

Anyone may suggest a video for a move. The video does not need to be your video, but you should notify the author if possible. For moves missing a video please follow these guidelines:

1. YouTube video title or just "Instagram".
2. Link to the original video. Please do not link to derivatives of the video such as Instagram or YouTube accounts that reshare videos.
3. YouTube channel name or Instagram account name.
4. Timestamp of move if a YouTube video, else 0:00 for an Instagram video.
5. Make a "Notes" section with comments if you are unsure about any of the above information.
   

## How to suggest a new move

1. Upload a public video of your move to YouTube.
2. Create a new issue.
3. Title the issue with the technical name of your move in title-case capitalization e.g. Quadruple Flyaway. If you are unsure of the technical name, make your best effort.

   * Type (Bar / Beam / Flip / Parallel Bar / Pole / Pommel Horse / Vault / Slant Wall / Twist / Wall)
   * Known aliases
